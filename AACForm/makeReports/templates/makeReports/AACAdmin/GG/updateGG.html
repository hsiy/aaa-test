<h3>Update Graduate Goal</h3>
Changing the goal text will update the text in all instances of this goal in reports - past and present.<br>
If this is not intended, create a new graduate goal.<br>
Uncheck the box below to set the goal inactive. Inactive goals cannot be included in new reports, and are not listed in most places.
