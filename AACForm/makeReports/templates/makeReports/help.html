<p><b>Q: Why are there no reports on the home page?</b></p>
<p>A: The AAC has not yet assigned a report to your department. Contact the AAC if you believe this is an error.</p>
<p><b>Q: A submitted report has returned to my to-do list with a "Modify" button. What does this mean?</b></p>
<p>
    This means an AAC member has reviewed your report and has returned it to you to make modifications. You can see feedback by
    clicking 'Feedback' and can make the necessary modifications by clicking 'Modify' and navigating to the needed section.
    You can simply resubmit the report when ready.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Q: How do I see reports from past years?</b>
</p>
<p>
    A: Click on 'Your Reports' at the top of the page.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Q: How do I see the rubric for the report I am working on?</b>
</p>
<p>
    Open the report by clicking 'Start'. On the far-right on the lower navigational bar there is the option to 'View Rubric.'
</p>
<p>
    <b>Q: What does the To-Do list mean when completing a report?</b>
</p>
<p>
    A: The To-Do list automatically updates as you complete the report. The list in each section covers the materials in that and prior sections. The To-Do list contains two parts: the required and the suggested. The required section lists what must be completed in the report,
    before you can submit it to the AAC. If you feel one of these requirements does not apply to your degree program, contact the AAC.
    They can submit the report on your behalf. The suggested section contains automated suggestions based upon the rubric. Sometimes these suggestions will not apply or be accurate for a given degree program. You will be able to submit the
    report without acting upon any of the suggestions. Please use your judgement. Finally, the To-Do list disappears if there are no more suggestions or requirements to complete.
</p>

    <b>Q: What is CSV?</b>
</p>
<p>
    The CSV allows you to export the data within the system in a comma seperated list. CSV can be easily imported into programs such as Excel.
    The option allows you to more easily do further data analysis in other programs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Q: What are not all my supplements included in the PDF of the report?</b>
</p>
<p>
    The application can only include files that are already PDFs into the report PDF. Other supplements can still be downloaded seperately.

<p><b>Q: How can I see reports to review?</b></p>
<p>A: With the top navigation bar, choose "AAC Reports" and search for not yet reviewed and submitted reports.</p>
<p><b>Q: What does "Generate Reports" do?</b></p>
<p>A: When degree programs are created, there is an option to assign a cycle length and starting year. For example, if 2015 is the starting year and 4 is the cycle length,
    reports should be assigned in 2015, 2019, 2023, 2027, etc. Generating a year's reports assigns a report with the selected rubric to every degree program whose starting year
    and cycle length combination indicates it should be assigned a report in the given year. However, it does not assign a report if a given degree program has already been manually assigned
    a report for the given year. Further, note not all degree programs will have a cycle length and starting year, in which case this button will never assign the program a report.
</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I manually assign a report?</b></p>
<p>
    From the Departments & Degree Programs page on the top navigation bar, find the desired degree program or the department the degree program is within. There will be the option to "Assign Report,"
    which will take you to the appropriate form.
